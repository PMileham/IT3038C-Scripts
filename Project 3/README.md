# Info
I improved and updated my Project 2 which calculated golden birthdays.

This code calculates your birthday moon phase! Enter your birthday or any date, and it will display what phase the moon was at that time.
-To run this script, you can copy and save the plaintext as "filename.py".
- Then you can open powershell and enter "Python filename.py" 
-Make sure you CD into the directory that you saved the script prior to running.
