This is my project 2

# Info
I improved and updated the nameage.py file we made in week 3 or 4.
```javascript
This code calculates your golden birthday. If you turn 25 on the 25th, that would be your golden birthday.
-To run this script, you can copy and save the plaintext as "filename.py".
- Then you can open powershell and enter "Python filename.py" 
-Make sure you CD into the directory that you saved the script.
